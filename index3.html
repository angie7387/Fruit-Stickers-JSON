<h2 class="faq-page">What are the best practices for harvesting fruit stickers?</h2>
                <!-- faq answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>1. Generally, the best stickers are around the melons and oranges sections. That's where the designers really pop off. <br>2. Make sure to check the grocery store for seasonal, fun items with new sticker designs. <br>3. Bring some parchment paper with you so the stickers can be peeled off easily if needed. <br>4. Try to find a fruit with a duplicate of stickers on them, as to not make the cashier's job harder if they need to manually type in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_look-up_code">PLU code.</a></p>
